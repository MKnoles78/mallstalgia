# Project 3 - Mallstalgia

## Description

MallStalgia is an app used to recreate the yesteryear mall experience, with today's technology. Patrons can peruse the clothing racks of multiple online retailers, while ordering food from our food court. It's all the nostalgia of fitting rooms and food courts, without the cramped parking spaces.

## Motivation

As developers, we wanted to build a full-stack application from the ground up.  We wanted to demonstrate our abilities and discover the flaws in our development process. Our team built this project using Sql, Express, React, and Node.js. 

## User Story

AS a user, I want to shop at the mall without leaving home
I WANT to to shop for outfits while I order food
SO THAT I can recreate the mall experience
